Type: Package
Title: Construct modeling features based on business.json files and Plenar.io
Description: This package is part of the Smart Data Platform developed by the
    City of Chicago. The Feature Fetcher is designed to ingest data produced
    by other components of the Smart Data Platform (SDP) and automatically
    create variables that can then be used in downstream modeling process.
    Starting with a business.json file which follows the specification of the
    SDP business.json format (https://github.com/Chicago/sdp-business.json) the
    Feature Fetcher provides tools to form the JSON into a table with fields
    that are calculated based on the inspection and business information
    contained in the data.
    Fields such as "number of inspections in past x days" can be automatically
    calculated, as well as a number of other fields generally used in the model
    process.
    This core table can be joined to other event based data that is calculated
    based on the inspection dates given in the table. Event based data is
    calculated based on a Gaussian Kernel Density Estimate.
